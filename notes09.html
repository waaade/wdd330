    <h1>Week 09 Notes</h1>
    <h2>The Window Object</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dialogs: alert, confirm, prompt</li>
        <li>window.location.href =     this can actually redirect the page</li>
        <li>window.history.go(-1) Go back one page in browser history</li>
        <li>A lot of things in this chapter you really shouldn't use it seems, which is why I'm not making notes about them</li>
        <li>Cookies are in many ways being replaced by localStorage, but you use the document.cookie property to assign values (they are like regular variables)</li>
        <li>setInterval: you can have it do something every x milliseconds. setTimeout: have it wait x milliseconds and then do something</li>
        <li>javascript can do animations but the css method is generally better</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data-: lets you attach a bunch of information to an html element</li>
        <li>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(callback) Gets your location (literally physical location)</li>
        <li>Web workers: lets stuff happen in the background. Give them a javascript file</li>
        <li>Media: tags for audio and video work the same as img. But they have a lot of properties you can control.</li>
    </ul>
