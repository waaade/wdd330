    <h1>Week 05 Notes</h1>
    <p>Shorter reading this week, so not too many notes.</p>
    <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Strict mode: 'use strict'; on first line of js file. Why did no one tell me about this sooner.</li>
        <li>You can put all your code in a self-invoking function with 'use strict' That way if you use someone else's code
            that didn't use strict mode, it won't cause any problems.
        </li>
        <li>Modules are in strict mode by default.</li>
        <li>Use if statements to see if the feature actually exists. That way you can handle it
            in case it doesn't (if the user's browser does not support the feature).
        </li>
    </ul>
